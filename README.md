# Maven Toys Data analysis using Excel

This project demonstrates my proficiency in using **Microsoft Excel** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The goal was to transform a raw, unorganized sales dataset from a fictional company, **Maven Toys**, into actionable business insights.

### **Project Overview**

The provided dataset was messy and lacked a clear structure for analysis. Management needed to understand key performance indicators (KPIs) and sales trends to make informed business decisions. I developed an automated and interactive Excel dashboard to provide a clear, visual overview of sales performance, profitability, and regional trends.

* **Calculated Fields:** Created new columns to derive crucial metrics.
    * **Profit:** `[Revenue] - [COGS]`
    * **Profit Margin %:** `[Profit] / [Revenue]`

#### **2. Data Analysis and KPIs**

* **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize and analyze data efficiently.
    * Aggregated total revenue, profit, and units sold by region, product category, and month.
    * Identified **top-performing** products and cities.
* **Conditional Formatting:** Applied rules to highlight underperforming products and peak sales periods.

#### **3. Interactive Dashboard**

* **Pivot Charts:** Created dynamic charts for a clear visual representation of the data.
    * **Line Chart:** Visualized monthly revenue trends.
    * **Bar Chart:** Displayed top-performing products by revenue.
